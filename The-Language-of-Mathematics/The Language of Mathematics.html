<p> Mathematical language was developed as an unified language to express mathematical concepts. It is expressed in terms of well defined mathematical objects. These objects can be numbers, points, functions, geometrical shapes, etc...

A <strong>set</strong> is a collection of objects called elements or members. There is no limitation on the types of objects in a set as long as a specification is provided to indicate whether an given object is in the set. One of the ways of making such specification is the use of the <strong>Venn diagram</strong>, named after the 19th-century Cambridge mathematician John Venn.</p>

<ul>
<li>ℝ, denotes the set of real numbers.</li>
<li>∗ ℝ, denotes the set of non-zero real numbers.</li>
<li>ℚ ,denotes the set of rational numbers.</li>
<li>ℤ, denotes the set of integers.</li>
<li>ℕ, denotes the set of natural numbers.</li>
<li>ℙ, denoting the set of all primes.</li>
<li>ℂ, denoting the set of all complex numbers.</li>
<li>ℍ, denoting the set of all quaternions.</li>
</ul>

The symbol ∈ is used to indicate membership of a set.

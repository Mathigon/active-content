# Interactive Elements

Every course is divided into multiple steps, each with a unique ID. These IDs are used as function
names in `functions.ts` when exporting the setup code for every section. Every function gets called
with a `$step` argument, when the corresponding step is revealed for the first time. Check
[types.d.ts](content/shared/types.d.ts) for the available properties and methods.

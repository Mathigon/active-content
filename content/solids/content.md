# 3D Solids

## Introduction

So far, we’ve only looked at the geometry of flat, 2-dimensional objects like circles or rectangles – but we live in a three-dimensional world. Every object we see or touch has three __dimensions__.

::: column.grow

A point has zero dimensions. A point just specifies a location but it has no size.

A line has one dimension, we can measure its length (l), but it has no width or thickness.

A square has two dimensions, we can measure its length (l) and, perpendicular to that, its width (w).

A cube has three dimensions, we can measure its length (l); width (w); and perpendicular to both of those dimensions, we have its height (h).

Plane Geometry deals with points, lines, and two-dimensional (2D) shapes like polygons and circles which do not have any thickness. __Polygons__ are plane figures that have only length and width.

Solid Geometry is the study of three-dimensional (3D) shapes that have depth or thickness as well as length and width. Even a paper has a thickness and is a 3D shape, but since its thickness is so small, we often neglect it.

::: column.grow

As soon as humankind began constructing complex buildings, we needed solid geometry. In some Babylonian and Egyptian texts, you can see that they are concerned about the problems related to the sizes of the pyramids and other structures they have made.

Since then, architects have been using 3D geometry to define the spatial form of a building.  Nowadays, the design of buildings is continually advancing by combining different 3D shapes and their properties.

Just like we’ve classified flat geometric shapes into a few categories like polygons or quadrilaterals, we can classify 3D Solids into a few different types:

__A polyhedron is a three-dimensional geometric solid with flat sides. The plural of polyhedron is “polyhedra”.__
The word polyhedron comes from the Classical Greek as poly (many) + hedron (base, face)

Polyhedra have many different shapes and sizes like polygons.
They can be as simple as a cube or a pyramid, or as complex as a star polyhedron with lots of sides.

There are also some 3D solids like cylinders and cones that contain curved surfaces, they are called non-polyhedra.

The Flatland is an animated film based on Edwin Abbott’s book Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions. The movie revolves around the inability of 2D shapes to grasp the third dimension. Characters are circles, triangles, and squares living in a 2D world. Their reality is shattered when a sphere from the 3D World comes to visit.

### Cubes

One of the most common types of 3D solids is a cube.

{.todo} IMAGES

A cube is a 3d shape that has 6 faces all of which are [[squares]].

{.todo} IMAGE: Rubik's Cube

::: column.grow

For instance, The Rubik's Cube is a classic toy invented in 1974 by Hungarian architecture and design professor Erno Rubik.  Each of the faces of a Rubik’s cube contains 9 colored squares. 

Although one of the smaller cubes (the central one) is not exposed, if we count carefully, we see that the Rubik’s cube is made up of [[27]] smaller rotatable cubes arranged in a 3x3x3 grid.

A cube has all its sides of the same length. If the length of all its sides is 1 unit, then it is called a unit cube. Unit cubes can be stacked together to create different 3D solids.

The 3D solids below consist of unit cubes. Can we find out the number of cubes used in each one including the hidden cubes?

Rotate the solids below to find the number of cubes that used to build them.

### Cuboids

::: column.grow

As with a square being rectangle, a cube is a cuboid.

A __cuboid__ is a box-shaped, where all six sides are rectangles. For example, pizza, cereal or shoe boxes are all cuboids.

Cuboids are some of the most common polyhedra we use every day.

An average pizza box has dimensions as 33 cm x 33 cm x 4 cm. It means it has 33 cm in length, 33 cm in width, and 4 cm in height or depth.
Sometimes a cuboid has two square faces and four rectangular faces like most of the pizza boxes.

::: column.grow

According to a legend, there was a devastating plague in Greece in 430BC. The Delians (citizens of a Greek Island, Delos) went to the temple of Apollo who told them that the plague will stop when they ___double the volume of his altar.___

:::

We can find the volume of more complex shapes by determining how many cubes of volume 1 it contains. 

The Apollo’s altar was a cubical temple with dimensions of five meters as its length, width, and height.

The Delians doubled the sides of the altar, but the plague did not stop. What went wrong? 

One way to find the volume of a cuboid is to fill the cuboid with unit cubes.

Volume is the number of cubic units that fill a 3D region, without any gaps or overlaps.

---

Let’s look at Apollo’s altar. If the edge length of the original altar was 5 units, then its base is a 5x5 square that has [[25]] unit cubes.

::: column

{.todo} Image for now, 3d later

::: column.grow

We continue to fill the altar by adding more cubes. 
The first layer is a 5 x 5 square made up from [[25]] cubes.

:::

---

    // Page 10

{.todo} INTERACTIVE: Area filling animation

There will be [[5]] layers of 25 cubes.
There must be `5 x 25 = input(125)` cubes to fill the entire altar. 

__It means the original cubic altar has a volume of 125 cubic units.__

The Delians did not follow the instructions carefully. They [[doubled each side]] of the altar. 
Let’s see what happened when they doubled the sides. 

::: column

{.todo} INTERACTIVE: temple area cubes

::: column.grow

When we double the sides of the cıube as the Delians have done with the incorrect altar, there will be [[100]] cubes and [[10]] layers. Therefore, the second altar they built had a volume of [[1000]] cubic units.

Doubling the dimensions of a three-dimensional figure will increase its volume by a factor of [[8]]. 

The Delians did not double the altar - they made it 8 times bigger.

:::

They should have doubled the volume instead of the side lengths.

::: column.fit

{.todo} IMAGE: base-height

::: column.grow

To find the volume of the cube, the number of cubes in the first layer is multiplied by the height. This first layer is called the base and usually refers to the top and bottom faces of the cube.

:::

---

    // Page 11

Recall the original altar. We counted [[25]] cubes in each layer. Alternatively, we could have calculated the [[ area | length | diagonal]] of the base. 
The number of layers we added constitutes the [[height]] of the altar. 

We calculated the volume of the cubic altar by multiplying [[Base Area]] and [[height]].

Base Area => `ABase = input(5) x input(5) =25 m^2` and height is 5 meters

`Volume = A_Base x h`

`Volume = 25 x 5 = input(125) m^3`

In other words, the volume of a cube is the product of its length, [[width]], and [[height]].

`Volume = length x width x height`

::: column

A cube has the same value as its length, width, and height. 
The volume of a cube with a side length of “a” units is 
`V = a • a • a = blank(x, "a3", "3a", "3 + a")`

Multiplying three edge lengths allows us to determine the volume of cube efficiently.

::: column

{.todo} INTERACTIVE: cube

:::

A cube with an edge length of 3 centimeters has a volume of [[27]] cubic centimeters, which we can write as 27 cm3.

A cube with an edge length of 4 inches has a volume of [[64]] cubic inches, which we can write as 64 [[in3]].

Volume is always measured in cubic units, such as cubic inches (in3), cubic feet [[ft3]], cubic centimeters (cm3), or cubic meters [[m3]].

Greek temples have a very predictable layout. At the center, there is a section called Cella that holds a statue of the God to which the temple is dedicated. The cella is surrounded by a long string of columns.  They are not always in cubic forms but mostly in cuboids.

    // Page 12

Helping to prevent any future conflicts, we can find a general method to find the volume of all cuboids?

{.todo} IMAGE: temple model

::: column

{.todo} IMAGE: floorplan

::: column

The first layer of the cuboid has [[24]] cubes. It means the base area is 24 square units.

[[Height]] tells us the number of layers it takes to stack up to the cuboid.

The total number of cubes to be used to create this cuboid is [[24 x 5 = 120]].

:::

The volume is 120 cubic units.

We again calculated the volume by multiplying [[Base Area]] and  [[Height]].

`Volume = Base Area x height`
`V = A_Base x h`

In other words, the formula for the volume of all cuboids is the [[product]] of its three dimensions.

`Volume = length x width x height`
`V = l x w x h`

Now it’s your turn – find the volumes of the following cuboids.

It is [[ not possible | possible]] to create a cube by using 24 unit cubes since 24 is not a perfect cube number.

How many different cuboids can you create by using 24 cubes?

By finding the missing dimensions of the different cuboids with a volume of 24 cubic units, we can observe how the base area and the height change when we have a certain amount of cubes to create the volume.

If the base area of a cuboid smaller than the other, then its height has to be [[bigger | smaller | equal to]] to have the same volume.

If two cuboids have the same height, then the one with the greater base area has a [[greater]] volume.

We now know about how to find the volume of the cuboids, can we find another measure about them as well?

_As a prank, you may want to cover your friend’s car with lots of sticky notes. But how many will you need?_

:::

---

Let’s create a model of the car to estimate the number of sticky notes we will need.

We can use the unit cubes to create the model of the car:

::: column.fit

{.todo} INTERACTIVE: car model

::: column.grow

You can rotate the model to find how many square units it takes to cover all the faces of this three-dimensional (3D) model excluding the bottom.

The sum of the faces of the front and back = [[8]] squares.

Top of the model: [[8]] squares.

Total of the left and right sides: [[12]] squares.

The total area is [[28]] __square units__, excluding the bottom.

:::

---

{.todo} DISCUSS: Do we need this blank? Perhaps we should do something else with it.

This means the surface area of the actual car is approximately 28 __square__ [[meters | centimeters | inches | feet]].

---

{.todo} DISCUSS: use equation editor instead?

If each sticky note is `0.006 m^2`, then 
we will need to have `input(28)/input(0.006)=4467` sticky notes to cover the car!

---

Here, we have calculated the __surface area__ of the car model to find the total number of sticky notes needed.

    // page 2

__The surface area of a 3D solid is the number of square units that cover all the faces of the polyhedron, without any gaps or overlaps.__

Surface Area = [[32]] __square units__.
The units used to measure the surface area are square meter (`"m"^2`), square centimeter (`"cm"^2`), square inches (`"in"^2`), square feet (`"ft"^2`), and so forth.

---

### SA : V

Surface area and [volume](gloss:volume) are different attributes of 3D figures.  The key difference between them is that the [[surface area | volume]] is a 2D measurement and the [[volume | surface area]] is a 3D measurement of a solid.

---

You may build different solids by using the same number of cubes.

::: column.fit

{.todo} INTERACTIVE: voxel painting

::: column.grow

Use 6 cubes to create a solid with the greatest possible surface area.

A cuboid with the surface area of [[26]] unit squares is the maximum surface area we can create by using the six cubes.

Now, create a solid with the smallest possible surface area.

:::

---

The minimum surface area is [[22]] unit squares.

---

    // page 3

Both of the solids you have created have a volume of [[6]] cubic units but have different surface areas. Notice the cubes that form solids with the more surface area are more [[spread out | compact]]. More of their faces are exposed.

---

In nature, having a large or small surface area with respect to the volume determines the vital characteristics of living things. 

The relation between the surface area and the volume of an object is so important that it affects where an animal can live when a cell has to divide, or the size of the wings of an airbus plane.

For instance, do you know why elephants have giant ears?

    // https://depositphotos.com/11745121/stock-photo-elephant-isolated-on-white.html
    figure: x-img(width=600 height=400 src="https://static9.depositphotos.com/1007373/1174/i/950/depositphotos_11745121-stock-photo-elephant-isolated-on-white.jpg")

African elephants are the largest land animals on Earth. They can be identified by their larger ears with respect to other elephant species. They grow up to 4 meters and weigh 6 tones on average.  

Elephants and all animals generate heat internally in proportion to their volume. Larger animals produce more heat with respect to small ones like mice.

Most of the reactions like heat transfer occur at the surface of the objects and living things. It means if a large animal lives in a hot environment, then it needs to lose heat by [[maximizing | minimizing]] its surface area.

---

::: column.fit

{.todo} INTERACTIVE: Elephant cuboid

::: column.grow

You may think of elephants as a 4 x 4 x 2 cuboid which has a surface area of [[64]] square units and a volume of [[32]] cubic units.  They need to increase their surface area to lose the heat produced by their large volume faster.

:::

---

    // page 4

::: column.grow

The ear of the African elephant is on average 180 cm by 110 cm.  Both ears add a total of [[8]] `"m"^2` surface area to the elephant. The ears increase the elephant’s surface area, while barely increasing the volume to make the heat loss faster.

:::

---

Alternatively, if you were living in the Antarctic you would want a small surface area to volume ratio. This would reduce heat loss and conserve it in the body. That’s why polar versions of animals are usually [[bigger | smaller]] with respect to the other species in the same family.

The relationship between the volume and the surface area as a shape's dimensions changes is a mathematical principle called the [square-cube law](gloss:square-cube-law). __(SA:V).__

Animals can be thought of as simple cubes:

As you continue to increase the edge size of the cube, [[Volume |Surface Area]] will grow
faster.

[Galileo](bio:galileo) might have been the first to formally recognize this when he stated in his 1638 book, Two New Science. In addition to biology, it has many applications in different scientific fields like mechanics, ecology, engineering.

### Nets

Artists and mathematicians like [Leonardo Da Vinci](bio:leonardo) devoted much effort to represent 3D objects on 2D paper. Da Vinci’s greatest accomplishment in this area is the illustrations for [Luca Pacioli](bio:pacioli)'s 1509 book _The Divine Proportion_. Da Vinci drew roughly 60 different illustrations of polyhedra in the book.

When the solids get complicated, drawing them on a 2D paper gets harder too. But there is another way to represent the 3D solids on a 2D plane.

{.todo} INTERACTIVE: Net construction

### Using nets to calculate the surface area

A __net__ allows us to see all the faces of a 3D solid at once. We can use the nets to find the surface areas of the cuboids instead of counting the numbers of squares in each face one by one.

    // page 11

Let’s find the surface area of this cuboid by using its net

::: column.fit

{.todo} INTERACTIVE: solid with a slider (solid <-> net)

::: column.grow

The net of the cuboid box shows three pairs of rectangles:

4 cm by 2 cm,

[[3]] cm by [[2]] cm, and

[[4]] cm by [[3]] cm.

With this information, we can now calculate the amount of cardboard needed to make the box; `(4 * 2) + (4 * 2) + (3 * 2) + (4 * 3) + (4 * 3) = input(52)  "square centimeters"`

The surface area of the cuboid is 52 [[`"cm"^2`|cm]].

:::

---

Use the slider to open the cuboid to its net. Then drag the side length measures to corresponding sides to find the surface area.

    // COMMENT: For now just include labels

{.todo} INTERACTIVE: solid <-> net

---

The pink rectangles have a total area of [[64]] `"m"^2`

---

The yellow rectangles have a total area of [[48]] `"m"^2`

---

The orange rectangles have a total area of [[24]] `"m"^2`

---

So the cuboid has a total area of [[136]] `"m"^2`.

---

Can we come up with shortcuts to find the surface area of the cuboids?

Let’s have a look at the cuboids here:

    // page 12

Use the sliders to open the nets of the cuboids.

{.todo} INTERACTIVE: solid <-> net

Drag the area calculations on the corresponding regions.

---

::: column.grow

`"Surface Area of the Cuboid" = ` _{x-equation(solution="2ab" keys="a b c" numeric)}_ ` + ` _{x-equation(solution="2bc" keys="a b c" numeric)}_ ` + ` _{x-equation(solution="2ac" keys="a b c" numeric)}_

::: column(width=250)

`"Surface Area of the Cube" = ` _{x-equation(solution="6 a^2" keys="a b c sup" numeric)}_

:::

---

Since nets are composed of plane figures that form the faces of a 3D Solid, we can always use them to calculate the surface area of even more complex solids.

::: column.fit

{.todo} Embed: https://www.geogebra.org/m/bXhjS2KJ

::: column.grow

Have a look at the soccer ball here, use the slider to open to its net. There are [[12]] pentagons and [[20]] hexagons. If the area of each pentagon is 30 `"cm"^2` and the area of each hexagon is 45 `"cm"^2`, then the surface area of the ball is [[1260]] `"cm"^2`.

The amazing structure of the honey bee cells has attracted the attention of humans for centuries. 

Bees collect nectar and pollen from flowers to make honey for their colony.  Honey provides bees the energy they need to survive and reproduce, as well as to build their homes.

    figure: x-img(src="images/ch3_43.png" width="1" height="1")

Honeycomb cells are actually a special kind of polyhedra called _{span.comments(text="(gloss:prism)")}**prisms**_**. **

Those identical faces are called_{span.comments(text="(gloss:base)I you provided a glossary definition draft in a previous chapter. If so, no need to rewrite it there.")} **[bases](pill:orange)**_**[.](pill:purple)** They are often used to indicate the _top _and _bottom _of the prism. Actually, prisms are named according to the shape of their bases. That’s why honeycomb shapes are called [[hexagonal | rectangular |triangular]] prisms._{span.comments(text="We should add a paragraph (and interactive diagram) that shows that all cross sections parallel to the bases are congruent.")} _

---

Imagine slicing a prism into lots of thin layers parallel to its base.

All cross sections will be exactly the same shape and size. The cross sections  will be **congruent.**

Think of a loaf of sliced bread, each bread slice has the same shape and size. The shape of the bread is a prism.

There are all kinds of prisms like triangular prisms, rectangular prisms, pentagonal prisms, and so on. The **cuboids** we’ve seen in the previous chapter are also prisms: [[_**rectangular]]**_** prisms.**

Honeycomb cells are always horizontally aligned. They share walls with the neighbor cell to decrease the amount of wax used to build each cell.

    figure: x-img(src="images/ch3_21.png" width="596" height="492")

Those shared walls are the _{span.comments(text="(gloss:lateral-face)needs definition | Bumping this. | Lateral faces of a three-dimensional figure are the quadrilateral faces ( mostly rectangular) apart from the bases of the solid.")}**[lateral faces](pill:green)**_ of the hexagonal prisms. The lateral faces are [[rectangles]].

In all kinds of prisms, the bases are connected by a set of rectangles _(or sometimes parallelograms) _regardless of the type of the base.

The _{span.comments(text="(gloss:net)")}**net**_ of the hexagonal prism can provide a better view of all the faces. There are totally [[8]] _{span.comments(text="Interactive Solid with a slider - color-coded faces, vertices, edges")}**[faces,](pill:blue)**_ [[2]] of them are the hexagonal bases and the remaining [[6]] of them are the rectangular lateral faces.

_{span.comments(text="This can be the next step of the previous animation")}_

Bees also need to have **maximum storage **for the honey without wasting more wax than necessary. This means that they need to use as little wax as possible to create their comb which can store as much honey as possible.

Recall the method we use to calculate the volume of the cuboids.

**Volume**= [[Base Area]] x [[height]]

---

Can we use the same formula for all prisms?

    figure: x-img(src="images/ch3_9.png" width="600" height="318")

    figure: x-img(src="images/ch3_11.png" width="600" height="651")

    figure: x-img(src="images/ch3_9.png" width="600" height="318")

The reason that the volume of a cuboid is calculated as _{span.comments(text="pill to the sliced cuboid")}**base area x height **_is that; the cuboids are formed by repeated layers of the same size base. 

Let’s look at these prisms to see if they are all made up of the multiple layers of the same polygon that they have as a base.  

[First scene: different prisms are given (non-sliced view) and not always in the upright position. Students can rotate the prisms to find and select the base area.](pill:blue)

[Second scene: After each selection, prisms can be sliced parallel to their bases to show they are made up of congruent polygons](pill:blue)

Rotate the prisms to select their bases. 

[For the triangular prism:](pill:blue) Let's look at the different slices of the prism.

All the triangular layers are the [[ same | different ]] size of the base.

---

[For the hexagonal  prism:](pill:blue) Let's look at the different slices of the prism.

All the hexagonal layers are the [[ same | different ]] size of the base.

---

Since all prisms are made up from the multiple layers of their base, we [[can | cannot]] use the same formula

---

**[Volume](pill:purple)****[Prisms](pill:purple)****[= [[Base Area\]\] x  [[height\]\]](pill:purple)**

---

Now, use the slider to try the different polygons as the base of the prism that could be used as a honeycomb. Average cell width and length for a honeycomb is approximately 4mm and the depth is 10 mm.

Compared to the other prisms that leave no gaps or overlaps (such as triangular and square), the hexagon prism creates a comb with the maximum volume. 

\----

Remember,  bees also need to use the least amount of wax possible to construct these combs Since they can only produce 1 oz of wax by using 8 oz of honey, the wax is very precious for them too. They cannot spend more wax than necessary.

For finding the amount of wax needed to build walls of the combs, we need to find the [[**surface area]] **prisms.

---

Using [[**nets]]** can help us to calculate the surface areas of the prisms.

We have already found the base area of the prisms.

The first pyramids were built in Mesopotamia, but the most famous pyramids are the Egyptian and Mayan pyramids.

Egyptians knew vertical walls got less stable as they got taller, that’s why they first tried stacked bricks at an incline. They realized that a pyramid gets you the most stability for the least material.

Thanks to the stability of the triangular structure The Great Pyramid of Giza remained the tallest building of the world for 4000 years until the Eiffel Tower was built in 1889. The Great Pyramid is the oldest monument on the list of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, built almost 4600 years ago.

Regardless of the shape of its base, a pyramid always has [[triangular]] **[ lateral faces.](pill:teal)**

Before starting to work on a pyramid, Egyptian builders had to calculate its volume in order to acquire the right amount of stone needed to build the pyramid.

Imagine slicing a pyramid into lots of thin layers parallel to its base.

All cross sections will be exactly the same shape but different in size. When you go up, the size of the slices decreases proportionally to the base of the pyramid.  The cross sections of a pyramid parallel to its base are similar but not [[congruent]].

---

Since pyramids are made up of decreasing the size of layers of the same base, we [[cannot|can]] use ‘_**area of the base times the height**_’ to calculate the **volume****. **

_**[“What do the nets of pyramids have in common?” ](pill:green)**_

_**They have  rectangles as the lateral faces**_

_**They all have triangles as the lateral faces**_

_**They have a pair of polygons that may not be rectangles.**_

_**They have one polygon that may not be a triangle.**_

_**Their **__**number**__** of lateral faces is the same as the number of sides of their base.**_

_In the previous chapter, we have also seen that there are many nets for a cube. What about the prisms and pyramids?_

_Is there only one possible net for them?_

_The polygons can be arranged in [[different ways | only one way]]  to be assembled into the same prism or pyramid._

---

You can arrange these triangles and rectangles in different ways to fold up a  triangular prism.

Use the grid to draw one of the possible nets of a triangular prism.

**[Then the other possible nets will appear.](pill:blue)**

**[like a shape-shifter ‘ a net closes forms the prism, then opens as another net and continues like that ‘](pill:blue)**

**[------](pill:blue)**

We may not build a pyramid or the tallest building of the world yet, but we can start planning for a treehouse (Playhouse /tent …) .  

Like Egyptians do, before we start building one, we need to calculate the amount of material we are going to use for the outer surface of our model.

A house-shaped prism is created by attaching a [[triangular prism triangular pyramid | square pyramid ]] on top of a [[rectangular prism]]. 

---

These types of solids are called **Composite solids.**

[A ](pill:purple) _{span.comments(text="(gloss:composite-solid)new term - needs definition. The definition here is good start. | A composite solid is a figure that is made up of more than one solid.")}**composite solid**_[ is a figure that is made up of more than one solid.](pill:purple)

    figure: x-img(src="images/ch3_28.png" width="1" height="1")

The base of the house-shaped prism consists of a [[[rectangle\]\]](pill:teal) and a [[[triangle\]\]](pill:orange)._**4 m**__**3**__** m**__**2**__** m**__**2.5 m**__**2.5 m**__**4**__** m**__**4 m**__**3**__** m**__**2**__** m**__**2.5 m**__**2.5 m**__**4**__** m**_

---

_**4 m**_

_**3**__** m**_

_**2**__** m**_

_**2.5 m**_

_**2.5 m**_

_**4**__** m**_

We may find the area of the rectangle and triangle separately and then add them up to find the [[base area]].  

---

[Rectangle’s area ](pill:teal)is _{span.comments(text="Equation field")}3x2 = 6 m2 _and the [triangle’s area](pill:orange) is _{span.comments(text="Equation Field")}½(3 x 2) = 3 m2_

So each base area is [[9]] m2

---

Now we can find the **lateral area** of the model;

  Is there a way to simplify the calculations?  

 Imagine unfolding the prism into a net. Use the slider to see the **net** of the house-shaped prism.

**[Color coded - rotatable - Interactive model with a slider to open its net](pill:blue)**

**[When the lateral faces open ;](pill:blue)**

Sometimes we can simplify the process by combining the lateral faces and finding the area of the combined region.

    figure: x-img(src="images/ch3_52.png" width="600" height="551")

[Scene 1](pill:green)

We can use one large rectangle instead of separate smaller ones.

We can treat the prism-like house as having three parts: two identical bases, and one long rectangle that has been taped along the edges of the bases. 

The rectangle has the [[**same**]] [height](pill:red) as the prism, and its width is the [[**[PERIMETER OF THE BASE](pill:red)**]]. 

---

[Scene 2 ](pill:green)

    figure: x-img(src="images/ch3_8.png" width="600" height="569")

**In fact, for all the prisms,  you can combine each rectangular lateral face and find the entire area by multiplying the height of the prism by the perimeter of the base.**

So the area of the big rectangle that covers all the lateral face of the prism is [[12]] x 4 = [[48]] m2.

---

[Scene 3](pill:green) 

Now, all we are going to do is to add two [[[base areas](pill:blue)]] to the [[[lateral area](pill:red)]]. 

---

So the surface area is [[66]]m2.

---

\----

What about the volume?

The [Base Area](pill:blue) was 9 m2 and the [height](pill:red) is [[4]]m.

---

Therefore, after completing the construction, your treehouse will have a  volume of [[36]] m3

---

You may have different designs for your treehouse but, as long as they are prism-like shapes, their volume will always be calculated as Base Area x Height.

_{span.comments(text="I am not sure to include this part since the chapter is getting longer and longer.  For example, we can create a house with a pyramid and a prism to find the volume. Shall I include those examples too? Or is it more like an intermediate content? | You're right, I think this would add length. If you end up building the volume interactive above, I think the idea is similar enough to this that you won't need to build houses. | I wonder if this is worth a quick conversation in slack or on a call? I keep going back and forth with ideas.")}[Animated Gallery;](pill:green)_

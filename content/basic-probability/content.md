Here you can see a spinner.

::: column(width=300)

    svg.spinner(width=300 height=300)
      circle(cx=150 cy=150 r="100")
      rect(x=140 y=50 width=20 height=200)

* Compare outcomes for different experiments, predict which experiment is more likely to produce a desired result, and justify the prediction.
* Describe how we can use the outcomes from previous experiments to help determine the relative likelihood of future events.

* Comprehend and use the terms “impossible,” “unlikely,” “equally likely as not,” “likely,” and “certain” to describe the likelihood of an event.
* Interpret percentages, fractions, and decimals that represent the likelihood of events.
* Order a given set of events from least likely to most likely, and justify the reasoning.

* Generalize the relationship between the probability of an event and the number of possible outcomes in the sample space, for an experiment in which each outcome in the sample space is equally likely.
* List the sample space of a simple chance experiment.
* Use the sample space to determine the probability of an event, and express it as a fraction, decimal, or percentage.

* Describe patterns observed on a table or graph that shows the relative frequency for a repeated experiment.
* Generalize that the cumulative relative frequency approaches the probability of the event as an experiment is repeated many times.
* Generate possible results that would or would not be surprising for a repeated experiment, and justify the reasoning.

---

* Describe reasons why the relative frequency from an experiment may not exactly match the actual probability of the event.
* Recognize that sometimes the outcomes in a sample space are not equally likely.
* Use the results from a repeated experiment to estimate the probability of an event, and justify the estimate.

* Comprehend the that term “simulation” refers to a chance experiment used to represent a real-world situation.
* Describe a simple chance experiment that could be used to simulate a real-world event.
* Perform a simulation, and use the results to estimate the probability of a simple event in a real-world situation.

## Multi-Step Experiments

> section: multi-step
> sectionStatus: dev

* Compare and contrast different methods for representing the sample space of a compound event, and evaluate their usefulness.
* Determine the total number of possible outcomes for a compound event, and justify the reasoning.
* Interpret or create a list, table, or tree diagram that represents the sample space of a compound event.
* Understand that the probabilities of all possible outcomes sum to 1

---

* Choose a method for representing the sample space of a compound event, and justify the choice.
* Use the sample space to determine the probability of a compound event, and explain the reasoning.

## Designing Simulations

> section: simulations
> sectionStatus: dev

* Describe a multi-step experiment that could be used to simulate a compound event in a real-world situation, and justify that it represents the situation.
* Perform a simulation to estimate the probability of a compound event, and explain how the simulation could be improved.

absolute-value:
  title: Absolute Value
  text: The __absolute value__ of a number is its distance from 0 on the number
    line. It makes negative numbers positive, but leaves positive numbers
    unchanged. The absolute value of `x` is written as `|x|`. For example,
    `|-5| = 5` and `|3| = 3`.
  # The absolute value of a number is the distance between the number and the
  # origin. This connects the notion of _absolute value_ to the modulus of a
  # complex number and the magnitude of a vector.

    __Algebraic numbers__ are the subset of the real numbers, which can be
    represented as roots of a polynomial equation with integer coefficients.
    All rational numbers (like `2/3`) and surds (like `root(3,5)`) are
    algebraic, and so are numbers that can be build from surds (like
    `(2 + sqrt(3))/(1 - sqrt(5))`.

    Those numbers which are real but _not_ algebraic are called _transcendental
    numbers_.

algorithm:

alternate-angles:
  title: Alternate angles
  text: |
    __Alternate angles__ are formed by two _parallel lines_ which are crossed
    by a _traversal_ line, and they are always congruent. In the diagram below,
    each of the pairs of angles labelled 1, 2, 3 and 4 are alternate. The two
    angles in every pair lie on a different parallel line, and opposite sides
    of the traversal.

    The angle pairs 1 and 2 are called __alternate exterior angles__, because
    they lie outside the parallel lines, and the angle pairs 3 and 4 are
    called __alternate interior angles__.

arccos:
  title: Inverse Cosine
  text: |
    The __inverse cosine__ function is a trigonometric function written as
    `arccos(x)` or `cos^(-1)(x)`. It is the inverse of `cos(x)`.
  # Basic idea: To find cos-1 (½), we ask "what angle has cosine equal to ½?" The
  # answer is 60°. As a result we say cos-1 (½) = 60°. In radians this is
  # cos-1(½) = π/3. There are actually many angles that have cosine equal to ½.
  # We are really asking "what is the simplest, most basic angle that has
  # cosine equal to ½?" As before, the answer is 60°. Thus cos-1 (½) = 60° or
  # cos-1 (½) = π/3. Details: What is cos-1 (–½)? Do we choose 120°, –120°, 240°,
  # or some other angle? The answer is 120°. With inverse cosine, we select the
  # angle on the top half of the unit circle. Thus cos-1 (–½) = 120° or
  # cos-1 (–½) = 2π/3. In other words, the range of cos-1 is
  # restricted to [0, 180°] or [0, π].

vertical-angles:
  title: Vertical angles

    intersecting lines. Vertical angles are always _congruent_.

whole-numbers:
  title: Whole Numbers
  text: "The __whole numbers__ are the counting numbers, including zero:
    0, 1, 2, 3, 4, …"

zero-product:
  title: Zero Product Property
  text: The __zero product property__ states that, if the product of two
    quantities is zero, at least one of these quantities must also be zero.
    For example, if `a × (a - 1) = 0` then either `a = 0` or `a - 1 = 0`.

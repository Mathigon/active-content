Can you draw a path that crosses every bridge once, but _not more than once_, without entering the
water? You can start and end on any area of land.

Can you connect each of these utility companies to each of the houses, without any of the lines
intersecting?

Try rearranging the cities on this map, and watch how the shortest path between them changes. You
can remove cities by tapping them, and you can add cities by clicking anywhere on the map (up to 8):

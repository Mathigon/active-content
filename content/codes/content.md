In the early 2000s, the Colombian government was fighting a civil war against groups of insurgents
and terrorists, who were hiding in camps in the South American rainforest. Occasionally, soldiers
were captured by these rebels, and then had to spent months or even years in captivity.

It is easy to lose hope when you’ve been chained up in a hostage camp for such a long time, unable
to see your family, and guarded by armed guerilla forces. However, in 2010, there was reason to
be hopeful: the army was approaching, and planning to rescue them shortly.

Unfortunately, it seemed impossible to tell the prisoners that help was coming, without also
alerting their capturers – that is, until Colonel Jose Espejo came up with an ingenious idea. With
his team, he wrote a new pop song, embedded a secret message in the chorus, and then played it
thousands of times over the radio.

To the rebels, it sounded just like meaningless music, but to the prisoners listening in, it was a
message of hope. See if you can spot the message – it starts around 1:30.

There are many other examples in our world, where we want to communicate with others, but we can’t
use our voices or text. Maybe your friend lives across the street from you. At night, you secretly
talk to each other using flashlights – without waking up your family by shouting.

::: column.grow

For example, one short flash might mean “hello” or “yes”. One long flash might mean “how are you?”,
and two short flashes might mean “good night”. Can you come up with any other signals you might
need?

{.reveal(when="flashlight")} However, even if you agree many different signals for different words
or questions, it will be difficult to have more complex conversations, or to talk about new topics…

### Morse Code

In the early 19th century, the only way to transmit messages across long distances was my mail or
by messenger. Companies like the “Pony Express” ran delivery routes with couriers riding on horses,
but it could still take days or even weeks to send a message between distant cities.

This all changed in 1837, with the invention of the [__telegraph__](gloss:telegraph). Using electric
cables spanned across the country, it was possible to send messages almost instantly.

:::

The first commercial telegraph was developed by William Forthergill Cooke and Charles Wheatstone,
and used compass needles to point at different letters on a display.

::: column.grow

One year later, the inventor [Samuel Morse](bio:morse) developed an even better version of the
telegraph, together with his assistant Alfred Vail.

Pressing a button at one end of the telegraph line closes an electronic circuit. This means that
current is flowing, which triggers a buzzing sound at the other end of the telegraph line.

> id: morse

To send more complex messages, Morse represented every letter in the alphabet using a unique
sequence of short beeps (called dits or dots) and long beeps (called dahs or dashes):

    .alphabet
      for letter, index in 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'.split('')
        div
         strong= letter
         x-morse(char=letter)

For example, to transmit the letter E, we just have to send one [[short beep|long beep]]. To send
the letter U, we have to send [[dot-dot-dash|dot-dash-dot|dash-dash-dot]]. Morse had invented a
new “language”, which we now call the [Morse code](gloss:morse-code).

    x-img(src="images/morse.jpg" width=280 height=300)

{.caption} This telegraph machine also records messages on a long strip of paper.

::: column.grow

Now we can send any message by first converting its letters into Morse code, and then tapping out
the corresponding dots and dashes on the telegraph.

One of Morse’s goals was to keep the messages as short as possible. This is why common letters
like E and T have a very short code, while uncommon letters like J or Q have much longer codes.

{.r} Morse code quickly became popular all around the world. Trained operators can send around 25
words per minute, which corresponds to six dots or dashes _every second_!

The most famous Morse code signal is “SOS”, which indicates that you have an emergency and need
help. It consists of three dots, followed by three dashes, followed by three more dots. Try
writing other words or sentences in this box, and watch how they are encoded as Morse code:

Morse code was also what the Colombian army used to send a message to the hostages. Translated from
Spanish, the message was _19 PEOPLE RESCUED. YOU’RE NEXT. DON’T GIVE UP._ Listen to the song once
more, and see if you can hear the dots and dashes in the background:

If you don’t know Morse code, this may just sound like part of the music – but the hostages were
soldiers who had been trained in Morse code, and recognized it in the song when they heard it on the
radio. A few days later, they were rescued and safely returned home.

It turns out that there were many other examples throughout history, where Morse code has been used
to communicate secret (or not so secret) messages:

### Codes and Information

Wherever we look, we are surrounded by [__information__](gloss:information), like books and
newspapers, numbers and charts, photos, images, music, or movie clips.

A [__code__](gloss:code) is a rule or algorithm that can be used to express information in a certain
format. One example is our _alphabet_, which can be used to express language as a series of written
symbols (called _letters_). Another example we saw before is the [Morse code](gloss:morse), which
expresses words as sequences of [[dots and dashes|letters and spaces|radio music]].

> id: smoke-signals

But this is only the beginning, and there is a huge variety of codes that can be used for different
purposes, or to encode different kinds of information. In this course, we will explore some of the
most important and most interesting ones.

::: column.grow

Codes are not a recent invention – they were used by ancient cultures, many thousands of years ago.

For example, guards along the Great Wall of China used smoke to warn each other about potential
attacks, and different tribes of indigenous peoples in North American each had their own signalling
systems. They, too, created columns of smoke by burning damp grass, which allowed them to
communicate over long distances.

{.r} Smoke signals are even used today, for example as a distress signal at sea. When a new Pope is
elected by the College of Cardinals, the outcome of each vote is indicated by black or white smoke.

> id: flags

There are many examples where words or letters are not the best way to express information. Here
are some other codes you might have heard of:

::: tab(parent="sticky")

#### Phonetic Alphabet _{span.check(when="blank-0")}_

Many letters sound very similar – especially when spoken over the phone or radio, with loud
background noise. That’s why the military, police, pilots, and many others use the __NATO Phonetic
Alphabet__ when they have to spell names. Here, every individual letter is replaced with a unique
word:

    - nato = ['Alpha', 'Bravo', 'Charlie', 'Delta', 'Echo', 'Foxtrot', 'Golf', 'Hotel', 'India', 'Juliet', 'Kilo', 'Lima', 'Mike', 'November', 'Oscar', 'Papa', 'Quebec', 'Romeo', 'Sierra', 'Tango', 'Uniform', 'Victor', 'Whiskey', 'X-ray', 'Yankee', 'Zulu']
    .alphabet
      for letter in nato
        div
         strong= letter[0]
         span= letter

For example, saying “Mike–Alpha–Tango–Hotel–Sierra” would spell the word [[Maths]].

::: tab

#### Maritime Flags _{span.check(when="blank-1")}_

Ships can use __Maritime Signal Flags__, which are hung from their masts, to communicate with other
ships within sight range.

    // https://depositphotos.com/39723603/stock-photo-colourful-signal-flags-on-a.html

{.caption} Decorative flags on a sailing boat

:::

All flags have different colours or patterns, and represent a different letter:

    .flags
      for l in 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'.split('')
        div
          img(src=`images/maritime/${l.toLowerCase()}.svg` alt=l width=50 height=50)
          strong= l

For example, if you see the flags _{img(src="images/maritime/i.svg" width=20 height=20)}_
_{img(src="images/maritime/c.svg" width=20 height=20)}_ 
_{img(src="images/maritime/e.svg" width=20 height=20)}_ on a passing ship, you should
[[watch out for icebergs|give them assistance|reduce speed]].

::: tab

#### Flag Semaphore _{span.check(when="blank-2")}_

__Flag Semaphore__ is another way to communicate using flags, which was used long before the
invention of the telegraph. In this case, all flags are the same, but holding them in different
positions indicates different letters:

    // https://depositphotos.com/77499298/stock-illustration-semaphore-alphabet-flags-on-a.html
    .flags
      for l in 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'.split('')
        div
          img(src=`images/semaphore/${l.toLowerCase()}.svg` alt=l width=90 height=80)
          strong= l

::: column.grow

The Beatles wanted to use Semaphore to spell the word “HELP” on the cover of their album with the
same name.

However, they didn’t like the way these specific letters looked – so they just chose four random
letters instead! As you can see, they ended up spelling the word [[ruiv]]!

### The Genetic Code

Codes even appear inside our own body! The [DNA](gloss:dna) is a long [molecule](gloss:molecule)
that appears in every cell of your body, and contains the genetic instructions for how all living
organisms work. It consists of four different components, called _nucleotides_:

    .row.padded-thin

        div(style="width: 150px")

          p.caption= a

::: column(width=260)

{.fixme} DNA Helix image

::: column.grow

{.fixme} We can represent each of these using the letters __{.m-red} A__, __{.m-blue} T__,
__{.m-green} C__ and __{.m-yellow} G__. You may see a string of something like
__CGATCGTTACGCGATTCGATCATTTGTGTCCATCGTGGG__. This is a _code_ for a sequence of molecules within a
strand of DNA. In this case, the _letter_ is the code representing the nucleotide.

{.fixme} More about DNA

> id: intro-end

Remember that the same symbol can mean completely different things within different codes. For
example, the letter _C_ can be represented by “Charlie” in the NATO Phonetic Alphabet, it could be
the maritime flag _{img(src="images/maritime/c.svg" width=20 height=20)}_, or it can represent
_Cytosine_ if placed within a strand of DNA letters.

## Binary Numbers

> section: binary
> sectionStatus: dev

### Fingers

How high can you count using only one hand, without skipping any numbers? When we count with our hands, we traditionally use how many fingers are up to represent the number. We have five fingers, so that means the highest we can count with one hand is [[five|four|ten]].

---

    table.finger-grid   
      tr
        for x in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

            .caption= x

---

::: column.grow
A drawback of this strategy is that there are many unused finger combinations. For example, this finger combination to the right would represent [[2]]. With our traditional model there are two fingers up, so it means two. But we already have a configuration for two! We're wasting valuable space.

{.todo} could possibly show a // TABLE with all the extra values...

What if there was a way that we could count much higher while still using only one hand? The secret lies in something called [binary numbers](gloss:binary-numbers). Instead of using the number of fingers up as our count, we have to do something a bit more complicated. We can treat each of our fingers as a __digit__ with one of two possible values: down or up. Down can represent the number __0__ and up can represent the number __1__.

If we want to use each combination of ups and downs to represent a different number, then how many combinations can we represent?

{.todo} Transistors


A [transistor](gloss:transistor) is like a switch than can be either on or off. Recall how in our morse code/flashlight examples we were constrained by the medium’s ability to be on or off. Computers store data in transistors, so they store data as a collection of ons and offs, or 1s and 0s. Just like we just did with our fingers (by putting them up or down). If a computer had fingers (up/down), they would probably count to 31 on one hand. Everything that’s stored on a computer, from text and images to video and sound is stored in transistors as sequences of 1s and 0s, or binary code.


---

### Binary to Base-Ten

Before we can understand how computers use binary code to store complex things like sound and video, we must first understand the basics, like how a base-ten number is stored.

Our number system operates as a [base ten](gloss:base-10) number system. Base ten numbers have ten possible values for each digit. 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and 9. In a base-ten number, each digit is worth ten times as much as the previous smaller digit. The first right-most digit represents how many [[ones|tens|twos]] there are, the second right-most digit represents how many [[tens|hundreds|fives]] there are, and so on.

| number | hundreds value | tens value | ones value |
| 432 | [[400]] | [[30]] | [[2]] |
| 907 | [[900]] | [[0]] | [[7]] |

---

Recall that binary numbers do not operate on the base ten number system, but a base-two number system. They do not have ten possible digit values, they only have [[2|1|5]]. In base-ten, each digit value increases by a multiple of ten (e.g. one hundred is ten times ten). However in binary, each digit value increases by a multiple of [[2]].

Let's examine the binary number that is 5 consecutive 1s. How much is each digit worth?

| __{.m-red}digit__ | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| __{.m-green}digit value__   | [[16]] | [[8]] | [[4]] | [[2]] | [[1]] |
{.table-small.grid}

---

So the full value of binary number 11111 is not eleven thousand, one-hundred and eleven, but is 

16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = [[31]]

---

Here are some 6-digit binary numbers. Let's convert them to decimal.

### Converting Base-Ten to Binary

Now that we know how to convert a binary to decimal, how can we convert a decimal to a binary code?

Follow the slideshow below.

{.fixme} make this design more consistent with the rest of Mathigon

    x-slideshow
      .stage.cheesecake(slot="stage")
        figure: include svg/ch.svg
      .legend(slot="legend") We have a full block of length #[strong 25]f.
      .legend(slot="legend") We always start with the leftmost digit. In this case, 16 is the largest power of 2 that can fit into 25. So first we test the #[strong 16s] place.
      .legend(slot="legend") We subtract 16, so we write a #[strong 1] in the 16s place. We're left with #[strong 9].
      .legend(slot="legend") Next we test the #[strong 8s] place. 
      .legend(slot="legend") We can subtract 8, so we write a #[strong 1] in the 8s place. We're left with #[strong 1].
      .legend(slot="legend") Next we test the #[strong 4s] place.
      .legend(slot="legend") We cannot subtract 4, so we write a #[strong 0] in the 4s place.
      .legend(slot="legend") Next we test the #[strong 2s] place.
      .legend(slot="legend") We cannot subtract 2, so we write a #[strong 0] in the 2s place.
      .legend(slot="legend") Next we test the #[strong 1s] place.
      .legend(slot="legend") We can subtract 1, so we write a #[strong 1] in the 1s place. We're left with 0, and we are finished.


Here is that simple method put into steps. 
// BUTTER: format it
When converting decimal number N into binary:
1. Start with the highest power of 2^n, d, that you can subtract from N. 
2. If you can subtract d from N, then write a 1 in that place and continue with N = N - d.
3. If you cannot subtract d from N, then write a 0 in that place and continue with N = N.
4. Divide d by 2 to get the next digits place.
5. Repeat steps 2 through 4 until you have written the 1s place.

### References in Culture and Whatnot

We've seen decimal, we've seen binary, but you can create a number system with any base. Cmoputers use something called a "hexidecimal" or base-16 number system to store colors. (// TODO: image of color palette with their hexidecimal colors on the right.)

Sports leagues often use tournaments where the number of teams is a power of two. The NCAA basketball tournament begins with 64 teams. Each round, half of the teams are eliminated. The rounds of 16, 8, and 4 are called respectively the Sweet Sixteen, the Elite Eight, and the Final Four. (// TODO: image of bracket)

The I-Ching is an ancient Chinese divination text. Each I-Ching "Hexagram" is made of six horizontal lines, each of which can be either solid (Yang) or divided (Yin). There are 64 possible Hexagrams (2^6). (// TODO: image of I-Ching)

Some codes are designed in a way that only

Alice and Bob

The science of creating secret codes is called __Cryptography__ and the are of
breaking them is called __Cryptanalysis__.

When designing ciphers, there are several possible objectives:

* __Secrecy:__ A and B can be sure that no third party X can read the message.
* __Integrity:__ A and B can be sure that no third party X can alter the message
  while it is being transmitted.
* __Secrecy:__ B can be sure that the message actually comes from A, and not
  from some impostor.

### The Caesar Cipher

https://plus.maths.org/content/cracking-codes

The diagram below shows how plaintext letters [{.letter.plain} *] are converted
into cipher letters [{.letter.cipher} *]. The chart also shows the relative
frequency of every letter in your text, as well as the entire english language.

    .code-play
      .freq-table-wrap
        .freq-table
          .freq-table-chart
            each l in ('ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ').split('')
              .freq-col
                .letter-bar.plain
                .letter-bar.real
          .freq-table-plain
            each l in ('ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ').split('')
              .freq-col: .letter.plain= l
          .freq-table-cipher
            each l in ('ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ').split('')
              .freq-col
            #letter-slider(data-slide-width="26")
              each l in ('ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ').split('')
                .freq-col: .letter.cipher= l
      .row
        .code-area.grow
          h3.code-title Plain Text
          .plain-text(contenteditable="true", placeholder="Start typing to create your first cypher …")
        .code-area.grow
          h3.code-title Enciphered Text
          .cipher-text

Once you know the pattern the Caesar cipher is very easy to break: you just have
to try all <25> possibilities. Try to decode the following secret messages:

### Substitution Cipher

It is not hard to make the Caesar cipher more secure: rather than shifting the
letters we could scramble all of them randomly. Now there are not only 25 but
26! = 403,291,461,126,605,635,584,000,000 possibilities. Even using a computer
it would take very long to check all possible combinations.

{.todo} Substitution Cipher Encoding Interactive

But it turns out that if we have a sufficiently long section of text, even the
substitution cipher is easy to crack – using what we know about the language of
the original plaintext.

In every language, some letters are more common than others. This means that the
ciphertext should also contain some letters more often than others.
